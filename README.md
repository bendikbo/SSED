# SSED - Sliding-window Sound Event Detection

This repository contains a sliding window sound event detection system developed for a master thesis at NTNU IES, with contributions by NINA - Norsk Institutt for NAturfroskning.

The codebase contains multiple backbones, and is (almost) fully configurable in both training and inference through yaml specified configurations.
